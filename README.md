# React Real-Time Commenting System

Real-Time Commenting System built on top of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and with [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/) as the data store.    
This is meant as a reference repository, currently there's no package available but you can follow my tutorials to recreate this project for your website: [my blog here](https://alessiofranceschi.me/blog/react-commenting-system).
